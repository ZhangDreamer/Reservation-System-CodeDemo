# Reservation System Code Demo

Welcome to the Reservation System Code Demo repository! This project provides a practical example of a laboratory reservation system implemented in the C programming language and developed using Visual Code Studio. 

The system is designed to facilitate the management of computer reservations, allowing users to check available desks and view reservation history.

#### The main features in this reservation demo are the following:

### Option 1: Check available computers

This option allows users to check all available computers in the laboratory and see which ones are occupied.

### Option 2: Reserve a computer

This option reserves the first available computer after given an authorized ID number.

### Option 3: Remove an occupant

Given an ID number that's currently occupying a computer, this option removes the person with matching ID from the occupied spot and makes it available.

### Option 5: List of authorized students

This option shows the list of every student authorized to use the laboratory (*note: In this demo their IDs are shown for the purpose of being able to test the system, but in practice their IDs would be private).
